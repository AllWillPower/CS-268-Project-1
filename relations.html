                        Moy and Yamin are close friends to Joel and Jennifer.  They met soon after Joel and Jennifer moved to the house they currently reside in when Joel took Willem and Alice to a play group at the library when they were near the ages 5 and 3 respectively.  Moy works as a veterinarian and Yamin works as an Economics professor and both help raise 3 kids.  Joel and Jennifer often meet with Moy and Yamin to play board games while their kids would interact.
