            <li>The website client is my dad, Joel Van Haaften.</li>
            <li>The navigation links and main heading serves as the website's header.</li>
            <li>The website has the 5 pages, Home, Images, Skilss, Poems, and Relations</li>
            <li>The website has a taskbar with the 5 navigation links.</li>
            <li>The website condenses to use a hamburger button on mobile devices for the main navigation links, and each page adjusts its content according to the screen size as well.</li>
            <li>The website uses a global stylesheet which contains the styling for the header and all colors and font families.</li>
            <li>The website has many images across its pages, and each has a related alt attribute.</li>
            <li>The website has a global favicon that it uses.</li>
            <li>All of the website's resources are organized accordingly into the folders, images, css, js, and an 'other' folder for a pdf file.</li>
            <li>I did not use any libraries, frameworks, or third party tools.</li>
            <li>Each page and stylesheet validates without warnings or erros.</li>
            <li>The website is stored on my Git repository, which I shared with you.</li>
            <li>All files use only lowercase alphanumeric characters.</li>
            <li>The website is served out of port 8443</li>
            <li>The website was set up with Let's Encrypt to use https</li>
            <li>All webpages' content are aligned on distinct axes.</li>
            <li>The website's header uses a regular sans-serif font, while the body uses the 'Rubik' font from Google fonts, which the head links to.</li>
            <li>The Relations page uses several radio buttons which alter which profile appears on the page and serves as the 'form' requirement.</li>
            <li>The Experience page has external links to new webpages corresponding to the places where Joel has worked, which open in a new tab.</li>
            <li>The source code has meaningful names for IDs and classes and uses readable indentation.</li>
            <li>The Images page utilizes an animation, which iterates through all the images, and is powered by CSS.</li>
        </ol>

            Joel's Critique
        </h2>
        <p>
            I felt that the colors were a bit cold, maybe try warmer colors.  I prefer reading dark text on a light background due to my transition lenses.  Making a website more accessible for my age group would necessitate making that change.  Resizing the webpage worked well, the pop down menu appeared when I needed it.  The button links were fine as well.  I liked the font sizes and the bulleting. The quality of the pictures was fine, but the picture of Moy and Yamin is too dark.  The functionality was fine.  On the Images page the grey background may not be needed.  Can you try it without the grey background?  The text on the relations page changes in size when you select a profile.  I think it would be better if it stayed the same after clicking on a profile.
