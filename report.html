            <li>The website client is my dad, Joel Van Haaften.</li>
            <li>The navigation links and main heading serves as the website's header.</li>
            <li>The website has the 5 pages, Home, Images, Skilss, Poems, and Relations</li>
            <li>The website has a taskbar with the 5 navigation links.</li>
            <li>The website condenses to use a hamburger button on mobile devices for the main navigation links, and each page adjusts its content according to the screen size as well.</li>
            <li>The website uses a global stylesheet which contains the styling for the header and all colors and font families.</li>
            <li>The website has many images across its pages, and each has a related alt attribute.</li>
            <li>The website has a global favicon that it uses.</li>
            <li>All of the website's resources are organized accordingly into the folders, images, css, js, and an 'other' folder for a pdf file.</li>
            <li>I did not use any libraries, frameworks, or third party tools.</li>
            <li>Each page and stylesheet validates without warnings or erros.</li>
            <li>The website is stored on my Git repository, which I shared with you.</li>
            <li>All files use only lowercase alphanumeric characters.</li>
            <li>The website is served out of port 8443</li>
            <li>The website was set up with Let's Encrypt to use https</li>
            <li>All webpages' content are aligned on distinct axes.</li>
            <li>The website's header uses a regular sans-serif font, while the body uses the 'Rubik' font from Google fonts, which the head links to.</li>
            <li>The Relations page uses several radio buttons which alter which profile appears on the page and serves as the 'form' requirement.</li>
            <li>The Experience page has external links to new webpages corresponding to the places where Joel has worked, which open in a new tab.</li>
            <li>The source code has meaningful names for IDs and classes and uses readable indentation.</li>
            <li>The Images page utilizes an animation, which iterates through all the images, and is powered by CSS.</li>
